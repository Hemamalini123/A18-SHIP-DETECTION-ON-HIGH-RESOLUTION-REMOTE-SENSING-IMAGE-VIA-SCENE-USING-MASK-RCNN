SHIP DETECTION ON HIGH RESOLUTION REMOTE SENSING IMAGE VIA SCENE USING MASK R-CNN
1.First open the jupyter notebook and satellite images will be given as input.
2.The images can be jpg or jpeg or png format
3.The images will be trained and detect the ships in the order of x-axis and y-axis.
4.The detected ships will be represented using aligned bounding box segments around the ships.
5.For categorizing the ships, we need to open the anaconda prompt.
6.we need to copy the IP address and paste in the browser.
7.Webpage will be displayed for categorization of the ships.
8.We need to choose the image from our module and upload the image.
9.In our project we are categorizing four types of ships as war, cruise, container, and accomodation Ships. It will categorize what type of ship it is and gives the output.
10.If some other images like rock or sand is given as input then we will get the output as none.
